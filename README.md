### Challenge-1: WordPress Theme Challenge

Please create a WordPress theme based on details provided:

*   Ensure Tailwind CSS is used

**Important Notes:**

*   You need to create a homepage only. Don't bother about inner-pages styling
*   You must use WordPress "Theme Options Page" for different settings. Do not hard code a lot of stuff
*   Please email and request a copy of ACF if required


### Challenge-2: WordPress Plugin Challenge

There are already more than 10000 WordPress plugins out there. So itâ€™s really hard to setup a challenge for you! Still, we need to create a playground for you. So we came up with a few ideas for plugin. Go ahead with any one below:

#### Challenge: WordPress List Plugin

1. This plugin will test if you are familiar with WordPress shortcodes.
2. Create a plugin which will accept items from the backend of wordpress & will display
that items list in front end with the shortcode.
3. Create a setting page for the plugin where user can add items to the list
4. List can be simply of,

        *  Item 1
        *  Item 2
        *  Item 3
        *  Etc...

### Admin-Side:
1. Create an admin-side settings page.
2. Provide an interface to add/remove items to the list from plugin settings page (Create a
separate page for your plugin settings).
3. User must be able to change order of the items in the list. (Hint: Use
http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists )

### Front-end:
1. Create provision for a shortcode like [mylistdemo]
2. When you add shortcode [mylistdemo] to any page, it will be replaced by a list of items
inserted from admin-side. Simply display the list of items. No need to apply css or styling
to it.
